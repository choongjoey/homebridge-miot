`homebridge-miot` is a plugin for homebridge which allows you to control any device supporting the miot protocol from Xiaomi! More devices will be added over time.
The goal is to add Homekit support to miot devices and make them fully controllable from the native Homekit iOS app and Siri.

#### This is a Work in Progress. Feedback and contribution is helpful and will improve the plugin!
#### Since the plugin was made with the intention to implement new devices easy and fast, it should be pretty straight forward to do that. If your device is not supported please create a request and specify the device model and type.

### Features
* Integrates miot devices into homekit
* Detect device types automatically if the device is supported
* Homekit automations for your miot devices

### Supported device types
* Fan
* Ceiling Fan
* Heater
* Humidifier
* Dehumidifier
* Air Purifier
* Outlet
* Curtain
* Fresh Air System
* Robot Cleaner

More device types will be added!

For a full list of supported devices by model check here: [all supported devices by model](https://github.com/merdok/homebridge-miot/blob/master/supported_devices.md).

## Installation

If you are new to homebridge, please first read the homebridge [documentation](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge#readme).
If you are running on a Raspberry, you will find a tutorial in the [homebridge wiki](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Install-Homebridge-on-Raspbian).

Install homebridge:
```sh
sudo npm install -g homebridge
```

Install homebridge-miot:
```sh
sudo npm install -g homebridge-miot
```

## Configuration

Add the `miot` platform in `config.json` in your home directory inside `.homebridge`.

Add your devices in the `devices`  array.

Example configuration:

```js

### Token
For the plugin to work the device token is required. For methods on how to find the token refer to this guide [obtaining mi device token](https://github.com/merdok/homebridge-miot/blob/master/obtain_token.md).

You can also use this tool to easily retrieve the token: [Xiaomi Cloud Tokens Extractor](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/Xiaomi-cloud-tokens-extractor).

### Configuration

## Troubleshooting
If you have any issues with the plugin or device services then you can run homebridge in debug mode, which will provide some additional information. This might be useful for debugging issues.

Homebridge debug mode:
```sh
homebridge -D
```

Deep debug log, add the following to your config.json:
```json
"deepDebugLog": true
```
This will enable additional extra log which might be helpful to debug all kind of issues.
